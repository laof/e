00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,333
Basic Concepts

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,900
after this lecture

5
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,800
we will be able to learn the falling objectives

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,566
understand the concept of information technology

7
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:38,066
discuss the history of computer technology

8
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:41,366
explain data storage and databases

9
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:45,499
describe the data retrieval and data transmission

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,500
understand data manipulation

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,533
explain the academic

12
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:53,466
commercial and employment perspective of it

13
00:00:54,766 --> 00:00:57,333
discuss the ethical perspectives of it

14
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,566
let's start with the basic concepts of information

15
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:12,666
technology

16
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:16,599
information technology has great influence on

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,133
all aspects of life

18
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,600
almost all workplaces and living environments

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,166
are being computerized

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,166
in order to prepare diploma holders to

21
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:27,766
work in these environments

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,166
it's essential that they are exposed to

23
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:33,166
various aspects of information technology

24
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:36,499
such as understanding the concept of information

25
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,366
technology and its scope

26
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,700
operating a computer

27
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,933
use the various tools of Ms Office

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,800
using the internet etc

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,266
these form the broad competency profile

30
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:50,599
of diploma holders

31
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:55,299
information technology is the use of computers to store

32
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,466
and process facts and figures

33
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:59,999
into a useful organized form

34
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,200
data is the raw material numbers and facts

35
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:06,699
information is the raw material

36
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,700
organized in a useful way

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,900
numbers are data

38
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,400
a telephone book full of numbers information

39
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,766
to emphasize the role of communications

40
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,800
some people use the acronym ICT

41
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:21,499
which

42
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
stands for information and Communication Technology

43
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,100
let's now discuss information technology

44
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,466
the term information technology or it

45
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:36,866
refers to an entire industry and an actuality

46
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:38,666
information technology

47
00:02:38,766 --> 00:02:41,166
is the use of computers and software

48
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,766
to manage information

49
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,500
in some companies

50
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,466
this is referred to as management information

51
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:49,499
services or MIS

52
00:02:49,866 --> 00:02:53,133
or simply as information services is

53
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:54,566
the

54
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:57,966
information technology department of a large company

55
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:00,933
would be responsible for storing information

56
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,800
protecting information

57
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:05,066
processing the information

58
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,933
transmitting the information as necessary

59
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:10,399
and later retrieving information

60
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,166
now we will study the history of computer technology

61
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:18,399
the history has been organized using these

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,933
widely recognized generations as mileposts

63
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:24,066
the mechanical era

64
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:27,766
1623 to 1945

65
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:31,499
first generation electronic computers

66
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:35,299
1937 to 1953

67
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,933
second generation 1954 to 1962

68
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:46,599
third generation 1963 to 1972

69
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:52,133
fourth generation 1972 to 1984

70
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,499
fifth generation

71
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:57,566
1984 to 1990

72
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:01,866
sixth generation 1990 to date

73
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,300
the mechanical era 1623 to 1945

74
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:10,366
the idea of using machines to solve

75
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:12,099
mathematical problems

76
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:12,599
can be

77
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,766
traced at least as far back as the early 17th century

78
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:21,466
mathematicians who designed and implemented calculators

79
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,466
that were capable of addition

80
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:24,566
subtraction

81
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,533
multiplication and division included Wilhelm Shrickard

82
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:33,099
Lace Pascal and Got Freed Livenets

83
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,366
first generation electronic computers

84
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,700
1937 to 1953

85
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,866
the first programs were written out in machine code

86
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,700
I e programmers

87
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,700
directly wrote down the numbers that corresponded

88
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,000
to the instructions

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,300
that they wanted to store in the memory

90
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:57,666
by the 1950s programmers were using a symbolic notation

91
00:04:57,866 --> 00:04:59,666
known as assembly language

92
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,166
then hand translating the symbolic notation

93
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,399
into machine code

94
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:07,333
later programs known as assemblers

95
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,333
perform the translation task

96
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:14,799
second generation 1954 to 1962

97
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,766
during this second generation

98
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,266
many high level programming languages were introduced

99
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:26,733
including formula translation for Tran 1956

100
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,266
Algal 1958 and Cobalt 1959

101
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,566
important commercial machines of this era

102
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,600
include the IBM 7 0 4 and its successors

103
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,566
the 7 0 9 and 7 0 9 4

104
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:46,333
the latter introduced I O processors

105
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:47,166
for better

106
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,466
throughput between I O devices and main memory

107
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:52,666
the second generation

108
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,200
also saw the first two supercomputers designed

109
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:59,099
specifically for numeric processing in

110
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,866
scientific applications

111
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:06,166
third generation 1963 to 1972

112
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,200
the first ICS were based on small scale integration

113
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,000
SSI circuits

114
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:17,066
which had around 10 devices per circuit or chipped

115
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,733
and evolved to the use of medium scale integrated

116
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,566
MSI circuits which had up to 100 devices per chip

117
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:31,099
fourth generation 1972 to 1984

118
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,566
the next generation of computer system

119
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:37,533
saw the use of large scale integration

120
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:41,266
LSI equals 1,000 devices per chip

121
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:45,599
and very large scale integration VLSI

122
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:48,699
100 000 devices per chip

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,766
in the construction of computing elements

124
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,533
developments and software included very high

125
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:56,599
level languages

126
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,800
such as FP Functional Programming

127
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,733
and Prologue Programming in logic

128
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:05,099
fifth generation

129
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,266
the fifth generation saw the introduction of machines

130
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:11,266
with hundreds of processors

131
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,066
that could all be working on

132
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,266
different parts of a single program

133
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,600
sixth generation 1990 to date

134
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:24,199
many of the developments in computer system since 1990

135
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,300
reflect gradual improvements over established systems

136
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:28,933
and thus

137
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:31,766
it's hard to claim that they represent a transition

138
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:33,166
to a new generation

139
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,800
but other developments will prove to be

140
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,400
significant changes

141
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:41,999
now we will learn about data storage and database

142
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:45,099
the term data storage can refer to

143
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,366
anything with information recorded on it

144
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:49,899
using this broad definition

145
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:52,799
a hardback volume of an encyclopedia

146
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:55,299
an audio cassette of a pop song

147
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,133
and even a piece of paper with

148
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:58,699
random words written on it

149
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,166
would all be considered examples

150
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,333
the most popular definition of the term limits it to

151
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,133
only the storage of information on computers and

152
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:09,466
similar devices

153
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,100
on site storage represents any type of storage device

154
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,866
that's designed to remain with the computer

155
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:20,266
or at a single location where the computer is housed

156
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:23,566
offsite data storage is one of the most

157
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:25,199
recent types of storage

158
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:26,699
in this type

159
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,800
information is stored away from the computer

160
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,566
at a distant location

161
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:36,733
database a database is a collection of information

162
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:38,599
that's organized so that it can be

163
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,066
easily accessed

164
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,866
managed and updated

165
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,600
in one view databases can be classified according to

166
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,900
types of content

167
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,733
bibliographic full text numeric and images

168
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,199
now we will study data retrieval

169
00:08:57,733 --> 00:09:00,533
data retrieval involves the capability to

170
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:02,066
easily select data

171
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:04,333
for graphic or attribute editing

172
00:09:04,566 --> 00:09:08,933
updating querying analysis and or display

173
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:11,699
the ability to retrieve data

174
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:15,466
is based on the unique structure of the DVMs

175
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:17,399
and command interfaces are

176
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,566
commonly provided with the software

177
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:22,899
a backup administrator must be

178
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,733
able to locate the appropriate backup media

179
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,766
and restore the lost data

180
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:30,699
within an acceptable recovery time objective

181
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,066
or RTO

182
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:36,899
excessive recovery time translate to lost revenue

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,200
and customer relation problems

184
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:40,899
some of the most

185
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,400
important issues involved in retrieving

186
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,566
data from backups

187
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:47,499
R setting the RTO

188
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,933
recovering is a process not an event

189
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,333
one of the biggest

190
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,733
challenges with backup planning is the

191
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:57,533
establishment of a realistic RTO

192
00:09:57,866 --> 00:10:01,366
that will vary depending on the technology in use

193
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,933
and the amount of data to be retrieved

194
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:06,133
reducing data

195
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,533
another way to accelerate data retrieval

196
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:11,566
is to reduce the amount of data

197
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:14,266
that must be backed up in the first place

198
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,300
media management and retention

199
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,666
data retrieval is also affected

200
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,699
by the management and storage of the media itself

201
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:26,699
tapes and removable hard drives must

202
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,700
be transferred to appropriate storage facilities

203
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,533
routine retrieval testing

204
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,199
most storage organizations

205
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,733
verify the integrity of their backups

206
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,466
by periodically testing the recovery process

207
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:45,666
for some companies testing is performed

208
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,500
on an ongoing basis as lost user files

209
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,966
are searched and retrieved

210
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,500
now we will study data transmission

211
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,066
data transmission refers

212
00:10:58,066 --> 00:11:00,933
to the movement of data in the form of bits

213
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,600
between two or more digital devices

214
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:07,066
this transfer of data takes place via some

215
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,766
form of transmission media

216
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:13,099
for example coaxial cable fiber optics etc

217
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,166
types of data transmission

218
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:18,266
parallel transmission

219
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,500
in parallel transmission

220
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,200
all the bits of data are transmitted simultaneously

221
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,699
on separate communication lines

222
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,533
parallel transmission is used for

223
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:31,499
short distance communication

224
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,766
serial transmission

225
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,900
in serial transmission

226
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,300
the various bits of data are transmitted serially

227
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:40,766
one after the other

228
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:44,366
it requires only one communication line

229
00:11:44,466 --> 00:11:45,999
rather than end lines

230
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
to transmit data from center to receiver

231
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,800
there are two types of cereal transmission

232
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:55,399
synchronous and a synchronous

233
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:59,666
both these transmissions use bit synchronization

234
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,466
a synchronous transmission

235
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,566
when the clocks of the receiving and sending computers

236
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,366
are not synchronized

237
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,566
the form of transmission is referred to as a

238
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:13,099
synchronous transmission

239
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,500
synchronous transmission

240
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:19,199
when data is to be sent from one computer to another

241
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,500
it's broken up

242
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,566
into individual characters and sent in sequence

243
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:28,066
such transmission is called a synchronous transmission

244
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:31,333
when the receiving computer uses a clock

245
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,200
that's synchronized with the clock

246
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,666
of the sending computer

247
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:37,666
the clock establishes a rhythm

248
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:40,166
types of data transmission

249
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:42,599
audio data transmission

250
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,066
video data transmission

251
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:47,566
text document transmission

252
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:51,499
now we will learn about data manipulation

253
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:55,466
data manipulation is the process of taking data

254
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,699
and manipulating it in a method

255
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,133
making it easier to read organize

256
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,666
for example a log of data entries

257
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,299
could be organized in alphabetical order

258
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,533
making it easier to view and find information

259
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,966
data manipulation is

260
00:13:11,966 --> 00:13:14,933
also often done with web server logs

261
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:16,933
to allow a website owner

262
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:20,333
to view their most popular pages and traffic sources

263
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,600
data manipulation language or DML

264
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:27,333
data manipulation language

265
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,299
DML is a structured computer language

266
00:13:30,466 --> 00:13:34,499
used in databases to manipulate the data in some way

267
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:38,466
a few of the basic manipulations used in

268
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:40,366
data manipulation language

269
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,900
include adding to the database

270
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:44,666
changing a record

271
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:46,666
deleting a record

272
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,166
and moving data from one position to another

273
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:53,966
there are two types to data manipulation language

274
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,366
procedural

275
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,400
the procedural way of

276
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,500
coding is often used in business settings

277
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,300
and is the proper way of coding

278
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,766
the DML request

279
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,966
non procedural

280
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,533
in non procedural data manipulation language

281
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,400
the user

282
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:13,766
only tells the database what datum to work with

283
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,700
but not how to retrieve it

284
00:14:16,966 --> 00:14:20,199
now we will study the academic perspectives

285
00:14:20,766 --> 00:14:23,366
in recent years there has been tremendous

286
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:24,899
progress in the area of it

287
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:28,933
this has changed our day to day activities forever

288
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:33,566
it has become a vital tool in modern society

289
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:37,266
and one has reached the point where societies

290
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:38,933
not having access to it

291
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:41,099
are at a disadvantage

292
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,466
nations that come to the forefront and ITV Arena

293
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:48,133
have enormous economic benefits

294
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:50,666
in accessing information

295
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,333
the internet has become the number one source

296
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,700
year end 1998 statistics indicated

297
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:03,199
that more than 147 million people worldwide

298
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,766
were accessing the internet at least once a week

299
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,366
from home or office

300
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:13,333
the number of internet users was projected

301
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,366
to grow to approximately

302
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,700
320 million by 2000

303
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,700
and to 720 million by 2005

304
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,166
the traffic on the internet

305
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,799
will double approximately every 100 days

306
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:31,999
this rapid growth in internet traffic is

307
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,066
generating a high demand

308
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,766
for both hardware and software products

309
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,166
as well as for skilled it workers to improve

310
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:44,333
implement and manage various systems

311
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,566
let's now take a look

312
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:49,133
at commercial and employment perspective

313
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:50,966
in the modern world

314
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:51,933
acquisition of

315
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:55,266
computer skills is becoming necessary for employment

316
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,300
educational development and leisure

317
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,300
computer studies intend to furnish students with a

318
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,500
broad knowledge

319
00:16:03,566 --> 00:16:06,299
of the nature of information processing

320
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,666
and how information and technology is used today

321
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,733
parallel to the rapid development

322
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:14,599
of information technology

323
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,066
is the uprising

324
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:19,066
of certain ethical and professional issues

325
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:21,399
as well as social implications

326
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:23,766
that were not thought of decades back

327
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:27,999
the internet particularly made a big impact not

328
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,900
only on the way

329
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,900
people around the globe communicate

330
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,600
but also it opened a wide door to information

331
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,300
changes brought about by information technology

332
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
are in the way one lives

333
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,699
perceives and does business

334
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:45,799
the computer is the target and the tool

335
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,866
for the perpetration of crime

336
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,500
it is used for the communication

337
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,100
of the criminal activity

338
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:55,066
such as the injection of a virus or worm

339
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:57,366
which can crash entire networks

340
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:01,066
now we will study ethical perspectives

341
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,666
some say that ethics has to do with religion

342
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,700
conversely ethics should not be confined with it

343
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:12,799
most religions advocate higher ethical standards

344
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:15,999
and yet if ethics were confined to religion

345
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,133
then ethics would apply only to religious people

346
00:17:19,966 --> 00:17:22,933
some say that ethics is something about law

347
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,933
however there are some unethical acts

348
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:27,566
that are not covered by law

349
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,099
however conforming to the law

350
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,766
is absolutely considered as ethical

351
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,100
furthermore some say to be ethical

352
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,566
is to do what the society accepts

353
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:42,099
but the society can be morally corrupt

354
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,566
in this sense

355
00:17:43,566 --> 00:17:44,733
ethics is not

356
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:47,699
generally related to the norms of the society

357
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:02,799
information technology has come a long way since then

358
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:03,966
and became a part

359
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:06,533
of our daily routine of everyone's life

360
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,100
both in business and social living

361
00:19:09,466 --> 00:19:12,799
it has drastically developed over the past decades

362
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:14,933
and is still developing fast

363
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,933
the generation of computers become

364
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:20,766
smaller with greater speed and capability

365
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:22,699
as generations pass

366
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,366
now in the end

367
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:27,199
let us sunrise what we have Learned in this lecture

368
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,466
in the 1960s and 70s

369
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,800
the term information technology or I t

370
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,733
was a little known phrase

371
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:37,199
that was used by those

372
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,566
who worked in places like bangs and hospitals

373
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,600
to describe the

374
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,466
processes they used to store information

375
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:48,566
the information that a computer has at any given time

376
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:52,733
is technically what data its central processing unit

377
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:55,666
or CPU can directly access

378
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,600
this information is called memory

379
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,766
and the components that store it

380
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,066
are considered primary storage

381
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:06,799
