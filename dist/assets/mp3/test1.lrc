[00:20.266] hello students and welcome to the lecture
[00:22.700] on Information Technology
[00:24.800] Basic Concepts
[00:27.000] after this lecture
[00:27.900] we will be able to learn the falling objectives
[00:31.600] understand the concept of information technology
[00:34.933] discuss the history of computer technology
[00:38.566] explain data storage and databases
[00:41.766] describe the data retrieval and data transmission
[00:46.500] understand data manipulation
[00:49.000] explain the academic
[00:50.533] commercial and employment perspective of it
[00:54.766] discuss the ethical perspectives of it
[01:08.700] let's start with the basic concepts of information
[01:11.566] technology
[01:13.366] information technology has great influence on
[01:16.600] all aspects of life
[01:18.500] almost all workplaces and living environments
[01:21.600] are being computerized
[01:23.600] in order to prepare diploma holders to
[01:26.166] work in these environments
[01:27.800] it's essential that they are exposed to
[01:30.166] various aspects of information technology
[01:33.466] such as understanding the concept of information
[01:36.500] technology and its scope
[01:39.100] operating a computer
[01:41.200] use the various tools of Ms Office
[01:44.200] using the internet etc
[01:46.400] these form the broad competency profile
[01:49.266] of diploma holders
[01:51.533] information technology is the use of computers to store
[01:55.300] and process facts and figures
[01:57.733] into a useful organized form
[02:00.600] data is the raw material numbers and facts
[02:04.366] information is the raw material
[02:06.700] organized in a useful way
[02:09.400] numbers are data
[02:11.200] a telephone book full of numbers information
[02:14.900] to emphasize the role of communications
[02:17.800] some people use the acronym ICT
[02:21.066] which
[02:21.500] stands for information and Communication Technology
[02:25.900] let's now discuss information technology
[02:29.733] the term information technology or it
[02:33.133] refers to an entire industry and an actuality
[02:36.866] information technology
[02:38.766] is the use of computers and software
[02:41.166] to manage information
[02:43.200] in some companies
[02:44.500] this is referred to as management information
[02:47.466] services or MIS
[02:49.866] or simply as information services is
[02:54.366] the
[02:54.566] information technology department of a large company
[02:58.066] would be responsible for storing information
[03:01.100] protecting information
[03:03.066] processing the information
[03:05.200] transmitting the information as necessary
[03:08.066] and later retrieving information
[03:11.400] now we will study the history of computer technology
[03:15.866] the history has been organized using these
[03:18.400] widely recognized generations as mileposts
[03:22.466] the mechanical era
[03:24.366] 1623 to 1945
[03:28.533] first generation electronic computers
[03:32.133] 1937 to 1953
[03:36.100] second generation 1954 to 1962
[03:41.866] third generation 1963 to 1972
[03:47.666] fourth generation 1972 to 1984
[03:52.933] fifth generation
[03:54.866] 1984 to 1990
[03:58.266] sixth generation 1990 to date
[04:02.600] the mechanical era 1623 to 1945
[04:07.766] the idea of using machines to solve
[04:10.366] mathematical problems
[04:12.133] can be
[04:12.600] traced at least as far back as the early 17th century
[04:17.466] mathematicians who designed and implemented calculators
[04:21.500] that were capable of addition
[04:23.466] subtraction
[04:24.600] multiplication and division included Wilhelm Shrickard
[04:29.933] Lace Pascal and Got Freed Livenets
[04:33.700] first generation electronic computers
[04:36.700] 1937 to 1953
[04:40.500] the first programs were written out in machine code
[04:44.300] I e programmers
[04:45.700] directly wrote down the numbers that corresponded
[04:48.700] to the instructions
[04:50.000] that they wanted to store in the memory
[04:52.933] by the 1950s programmers were using a symbolic notation
[04:57.866] known as assembly language
[04:59.966] then hand translating the symbolic notation
[05:03.166] into machine code
[05:04.966] later programs known as assemblers
[05:07.333] perform the translation task
[05:10.266] second generation 1954 to 1962
[05:15.733] during this second generation
[05:17.800] many high level programming languages were introduced
[05:21.466] including formula translation for Tran 1956
[05:27.200] Algal 1958 and Cobalt 1959
[05:33.166] important commercial machines of this era
[05:35.700] include the IBM 7 0 4 and its successors
[05:39.600] the 7 0 9 and 7 0 9 4
[05:43.466] the latter introduced I O processors
[05:46.366] for better
[05:47.166] throughput between I O devices and main memory
[05:51.133] the second generation
[05:52.800] also saw the first two supercomputers designed
[05:56.466] specifically for numeric processing in
[05:59.100] scientific applications
[06:01.733] third generation 1963 to 1972
[06:06.800] the first ICS were based on small scale integration
[06:11.300] SSI circuits
[06:13.133] which had around 10 devices per circuit or chipped
[06:17.333] and evolved to the use of medium scale integrated
[06:20.800] MSI circuits which had up to 100 devices per chip
[06:26.566] fourth generation 1972 to 1984
[06:31.800] the next generation of computer system
[06:34.566] saw the use of large scale integration
[06:37.766] LSI equals 1,000 devices per chip
[06:41.566] and very large scale integration VLSI
[06:46.133] 100 000 devices per chip
[06:49.000] in the construction of computing elements
[06:52.500] developments and software included very high
[06:55.533] level languages
[06:56.600] such as FP Functional Programming
[07:00.100] and Prologue Programming in logic
[07:03.566] fifth generation
[07:05.400] the fifth generation saw the introduction of machines
[07:09.266] with hundreds of processors
[07:11.333] that could all be working on
[07:13.166] different parts of a single program
[07:16.400] sixth generation 1990 to date
[07:20.166] many of the developments in computer system since 1990
[07:24.300] reflect gradual improvements over established systems
[07:28.333] and thus
[07:28.933] it's hard to claim that they represent a transition
[07:31.766] to a new generation
[07:33.600] but other developments will prove to be
[07:35.800] significant changes
[07:38.566] now we will learn about data storage and database
[07:42.533] the term data storage can refer to
[07:45.166] anything with information recorded on it
[07:47.866] using this broad definition
[07:49.933] a hardback volume of an encyclopedia
[07:52.966] an audio cassette of a pop song
[07:55.300] and even a piece of paper with
[07:57.133] random words written on it
[07:58.800] would all be considered examples
[08:01.700] the most popular definition of the term limits it to
[08:05.400] only the storage of information on computers and
[08:08.133] similar devices
[08:10.100] on site storage represents any type of storage device
[08:14.166] that's designed to remain with the computer
[08:16.933] or at a single location where the computer is housed
[08:21.066] offsite data storage is one of the most
[08:23.566] recent types of storage
[08:25.666] in this type
[08:26.700] information is stored away from the computer
[08:29.800] at a distant location
[08:32.366] database a database is a collection of information
[08:36.733] that's organized so that it can be
[08:38.600] easily accessed
[08:40.200] managed and updated
[08:43.700] in one view databases can be classified according to
[08:47.600] types of content
[08:49.300] bibliographic full text numeric and images
[08:54.533] now we will study data retrieval
[08:57.733] data retrieval involves the capability to
[09:00.533] easily select data
[09:02.066] for graphic or attribute editing
[09:04.566] updating querying analysis and or display
[09:09.566] the ability to retrieve data
[09:11.733] is based on the unique structure of the DVMs
[09:15.533] and command interfaces are
[09:17.400] commonly provided with the software
[09:20.366] a backup administrator must be
[09:22.900] able to locate the appropriate backup media
[09:25.933] and restore the lost data
[09:27.766] within an acceptable recovery time objective
[09:30.800] or RTO
[09:33.166] excessive recovery time translate to lost revenue
[09:37.000] and customer relation problems
[09:39.933] some of the most
[09:40.900] important issues involved in retrieving
[09:43.400] data from backups
[09:44.566] R setting the RTO
[09:48.000] recovering is a process not an event
[09:51.166] one of the biggest
[09:52.333] challenges with backup planning is the
[09:54.733] establishment of a realistic RTO
[09:57.866] that will vary depending on the technology in use
[10:01.600] and the amount of data to be retrieved
[10:04.733] reducing data
[10:06.800] another way to accelerate data retrieval
[10:09.533] is to reduce the amount of data
[10:11.733] that must be backed up in the first place
[10:15.100] media management and retention
[10:17.900] data retrieval is also affected
[10:20.666] by the management and storage of the media itself
[10:24.266] tapes and removable hard drives must
[10:26.700] be transferred to appropriate storage facilities
[10:30.400] routine retrieval testing
[10:33.166] most storage organizations
[10:35.200] verify the integrity of their backups
[10:37.800] by periodically testing the recovery process
[10:42.566] for some companies testing is performed
[10:45.700] on an ongoing basis as lost user files
[10:49.666] are searched and retrieved
[10:52.900] now we will study data transmission
[10:56.200] data transmission refers
[10:58.066] to the movement of data in the form of bits
[11:01.200] between two or more digital devices
[11:04.066] this transfer of data takes place via some
[11:07.066] form of transmission media
[11:09.133] for example coaxial cable fiber optics etc
[11:14.333] types of data transmission
[11:16.533] parallel transmission
[11:18.700] in parallel transmission
[11:20.500] all the bits of data are transmitted simultaneously
[11:24.333] on separate communication lines
[11:27.200] parallel transmission is used for
[11:29.533] short distance communication
[11:32.300] serial transmission
[11:34.200] in serial transmission
[11:35.900] the various bits of data are transmitted serially
[11:39.466] one after the other
[11:41.266] it requires only one communication line
[11:44.466] rather than end lines
[11:46.000] to transmit data from center to receiver
[11:50.000] there are two types of cereal transmission
[11:53.133] synchronous and a synchronous
[11:55.966] both these transmissions use bit synchronization
[12:00.500] a synchronous transmission
[12:03.000] when the clocks of the receiving and sending computers
[12:06.600] are not synchronized
[12:08.600] the form of transmission is referred to as a
[12:11.566] synchronous transmission
[12:13.900] synchronous transmission
[12:15.766] when data is to be sent from one computer to another
[12:19.300] it's broken up
[12:20.500] into individual characters and sent in sequence
[12:24.333] such transmission is called a synchronous transmission
[12:28.266] when the receiving computer uses a clock
[12:31.400] that's synchronized with the clock
[12:33.200] of the sending computer
[12:35.366] the clock establishes a rhythm
[12:38.266] types of data transmission
[12:40.566] audio data transmission
[12:43.333] video data transmission
[12:45.366] text document transmission
[12:48.733] now we will learn about data manipulation
[12:52.066] data manipulation is the process of taking data
[12:55.666] and manipulating it in a method
[12:57.700] making it easier to read organize
[13:00.800] for example a log of data entries
[13:03.666] could be organized in alphabetical order
[13:06.500] making it easier to view and find information
[13:10.200] data manipulation is
[13:11.966] also often done with web server logs
[13:15.066] to allow a website owner
[13:16.933] to view their most popular pages and traffic sources
[13:21.300] data manipulation language or DML
[13:25.366] data manipulation language
[13:27.333] DML is a structured computer language
[13:30.466] used in databases to manipulate the data in some way
[13:35.266] a few of the basic manipulations used in
[13:38.466] data manipulation language
[13:40.500] include adding to the database
[13:43.133] changing a record
[13:45.133] deleting a record
[13:46.900] and moving data from one position to another
[13:51.066] there are two types to data manipulation language
[13:54.200] procedural
[13:56.000] the procedural way of
[13:57.400] coding is often used in business settings
[14:00.500] and is the proper way of coding
[14:02.300] the DML request
[14:04.600] non procedural
[14:06.333] in non procedural data manipulation language
[14:09.600] the user
[14:10.533] only tells the database what datum to work with
[14:13.900] but not how to retrieve it
[14:16.966] now we will study the academic perspectives
[14:20.766] in recent years there has been tremendous
[14:23.366] progress in the area of it
[14:25.766] this has changed our day to day activities forever
[14:29.666] it has become a vital tool in modern society
[14:33.866] and one has reached the point where societies
[14:37.266] not having access to it
[14:39.466] are at a disadvantage
[14:42.000] nations that come to the forefront and ITV Arena
[14:45.533] have enormous economic benefits
[14:48.533] in accessing information
[14:51.266] the internet has become the number one source
[14:55.000] year end 1998 statistics indicated
[14:58.866] that more than 147 million people worldwide
[15:03.300] were accessing the internet at least once a week
[15:06.866] from home or office
[15:10.533] the number of internet users was projected
[15:13.333] to grow to approximately
[15:15.500] 320 million by 2000
[15:18.800] and to 720 million by 2005
[15:23.400] the traffic on the internet
[15:25.166] will double approximately every 100 days
[15:29.133] this rapid growth in internet traffic is
[15:32.000] generating a high demand
[15:34.166] for both hardware and software products
[15:37.000] as well as for skilled it workers to improve
[15:41.266] implement and manage various systems
[15:45.166] let's now take a look
[15:46.566] at commercial and employment perspective
[15:49.766] in the modern world
[15:50.966] acquisition of
[15:51.933] computer skills is becoming necessary for employment
[15:55.600] educational development and leisure
[15:59.000] computer studies intend to furnish students with a
[16:02.300] broad knowledge
[16:03.566] of the nature of information processing
[16:06.400] and how information and technology is used today
[16:10.600] parallel to the rapid development
[16:12.733] of information technology
[16:14.766] is the uprising
[16:16.066] of certain ethical and professional issues
[16:19.133] as well as social implications
[16:21.466] that were not thought of decades back
[16:24.533] the internet particularly made a big impact not
[16:28.000] only on the way
[16:28.900] people around the globe communicate
[16:31.100] but also it opened a wide door to information
[16:35.300] changes brought about by information technology
[16:38.400] are in the way one lives
[16:40.533] perceives and does business
[16:43.366] the computer is the target and the tool
[16:45.800] for the perpetration of crime
[16:48.300] it is used for the communication
[16:50.500] of the criminal activity
[16:52.133] such as the injection of a virus or worm
[16:55.133] which can crash entire networks
[16:58.366] now we will study ethical perspectives
[17:01.600] some say that ethics has to do with religion
[17:05.000] conversely ethics should not be confined with it
[17:09.266] most religions advocate higher ethical standards
[17:12.966] and yet if ethics were confined to religion
[17:16.100] then ethics would apply only to religious people
[17:19.966] some say that ethics is something about law
[17:23.333] however there are some unethical acts
[17:25.933] that are not covered by law
[17:28.166] however conforming to the law
[17:30.100] is absolutely considered as ethical
[17:33.300] furthermore some say to be ethical
[17:36.100] is to do what the society accepts
[17:39.133] but the society can be morally corrupt
[17:42.500] in this sense
[17:43.566] ethics is not
[17:44.766] generally related to the norms of the society
[18:59.133] information technology has come a long way since then
[19:02.966] and became a part
[19:03.966] of our daily routine of everyone's life
[19:06.600] both in business and social living
[19:09.466] it has drastically developed over the past decades
[19:12.866] and is still developing fast
[19:15.700] the generation of computers become
[19:17.966] smaller with greater speed and capability
[19:20.766] as generations pass
[19:23.600] now in the end
[19:24.366] let us sunrise what we have Learned in this lecture
[19:28.000] in the 1960s and 70s
[19:30.500] the term information technology or I t
[19:34.100] was a little known phrase
[19:35.733] that was used by those
[19:37.200] who worked in places like bangs and hospitals
[19:40.700] to describe the
[19:41.600] processes they used to store information
[19:45.266] the information that a computer has at any given time
[19:48.733] is technically what data its central processing unit
[19:52.766] or CPU can directly access
[19:56.200] this information is called memory
[19:58.600] and the components that store it
[20:00.800] are considered primary storage
[20:03.866] a database is a collection of information
[20:06.900] that is organized so that it can easily be accessed
[20:10.600] managed and updated
[20:14.066] in one view databases can be classified
[20:17.533] according to types of content
[20:20.066] bibliographic
[20:21.500] full text numeric and images
[20:25.066] queering is the capability to retrieve data
[20:28.533] usually a data subset
[20:30.500] based on some user defined formula
[20:33.566] these data subsets are often referred to
[20:36.533] as logical views
[20:39.000] data transmission refers to the movement of data
[20:42.566] in the form of
[20:43.400] bits between two or more digital devices
[20:46.900] this transfer of data takes place via some
[20:50.100] form of transmission media
